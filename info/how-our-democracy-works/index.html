<p>All institutions and agencies of the State and government at every level are accountable to Parliament. The Cabinet and the Council of Ministers hold legislative power along with the elected Parliament. The Cabinet, overseen by the president, is the policy decision-making body.</p>

<p><strong>Composition of National Assembly</strong></p>

<p>(1) The National Assembly consists of:</p>

<p>210 members elected by secret ballot from the two hundred and ten constituencies into which Zimbabwe is divided.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Provide for other privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and its Members and officers;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Define conduct which constitutes contempt of Parliament, whether committed by Members of Parliament or other people;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Provide for a right of reply, through the Speaker or the President of the Senate, as the case may be, for persons who are unjustly injured by what is said about them in Parliament; but no such Act may permit Parliament or its Members or officers to impose any punishment in the nature of a criminal penalty, other than a fine, for breach of privilege or contempt of Parliament.</p>

<p><strong>Duration and dissolution of Parliament</strong></p>

<p>Parliament is elected for a five-year term which runs from the date on which the</p>

<p>President-elect is sworn in and assumes office and Parliament stands dissolved at midnight on the day before the first polling day in the next general election.</p>

<p>The President must by proclamation dissolve Parliament if the Senate and the National Assembly, sitting separately, by the votes of at least two-thirds of the total membership of each House, have passed resolutions to dissolve.</p>
