The name 'Hansard' comes from Thomas Cursan Hansard, the man who is generally credited with first reporting the debates in the House of Commons in Westminster in 1811, as an unofficial observer. His name has served as the unofficial title for this document in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries ever since and has become officially recognised in recent years.

 

Zimbabwean Hansard follows the principles laid down in 1907 by the House of Commons Select Committee on Parliamentary Debates, that; It is a full report, in the first person, of all speakers alike, a full report being defined as; '...one which, though not strictly verbatim, is substantially the verbatim report, with repetitions and redundancies omitted and with obvious mistakes corrected, but which on the other hand leaves out nothing but adds to the meaning of the speech or illustrates the argument.

 

The final transcripts of Parliamentary debates are ready for the printer two hours after Parliament was adjourned. The whole process results in an overnight production of debates and proceedings. It should be noted that Parliament of Zimbabwe is one of the few Parliaments that produce Hansard overnight .

 

Printed Hansard copies are available and delivered to Parliament by 0900 hours on the morning after Sitting.
