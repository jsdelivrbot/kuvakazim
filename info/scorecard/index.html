  <p>General Scorecard FAQs</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>1) What is the aim of the scorecards?</strong></p>

<p>The aim of the MP scorecards is to give a simple, clear way for citizens to assess the performance of the MP.</p>

<p><strong>2) What measures have been used to create the scorecard?</strong></p>

<p>At the moment the measures used are Contactability, Appearances in Hansard and CDF spending performance. More details on the individual measures can  be read in the detailed FAQs below</p>

<p><strong>3) Will you be adding more measures to the scorecard?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, as more data becomes available we will be adding more measures to the scorecard</p>

<p><strong>4) How did you come to choose the measures selected for the scorecard?</strong></p>

<p>Care has been taken to select measure where the source of the data is clear and unambiguous and can be applied across all MPs in a fair manner. Contactability is based upon the different contact and communication means we have on the site for MP = they can at any time provide us with more information to update our records and improve their rating. Hansard appearances are taken from the official Hansard record.</p>

<p><strong>5) Why are the CDF scorecards not available for every MP?</strong></p>

<p>We have new MPs who were elected this year (2013) and were not part of the Parliament in which the first CDF were disbursed.</p>

<p><strong>6) How is the overall scorecard rating calculated?</strong></p>

<p>Overall score is averaged with every good smiley face contributing +1, every neutral face contributing zero and every bad frown face contribution -1. The resulting value mapped to good/neutral using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>average score &gt;= 0.5 -&gt; Good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>0.5 &lt; average score &lt; 0.5 -&gt; Neutral</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>average score &lt;= -0.5 -&gt; Bad</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7) I think that you have made a mistake on one of your measures, what should I do?</strong></p>

<p>For Contactability and Hansard, the measures are automatically calculated using our data - see below for more information. If you have additional contact details you would like to supply, or a query on Hansard appearances, please contact us using the buttons on the appropriate pages.</p>

<p><strong>Contactability</strong></p>

<p><strong>1) What does Contactability mean as a measure? Why have you chosen it?</strong></p>

<p>Contactability reflects the number of different ways a citizen can contact or hear from their MP. This includes postal address, email, phone, a website, Facebook and Twitter. We believe this is an important measure because as elected representatives, MPs must make themselves available to the citizens who elected them.</p>

<p><strong>2) How is Contactability calculated?</strong></p>

<p>A score of one point for each one of these contact options for which we have information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Contact Address</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contact Phone</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contact Email</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Facebook Presence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twitter Presence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blog</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The maximum score is therefore 5. The scorecard measure is then calculated like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Score 4-6: Good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Score 3: Neutral</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Score 1-2: Bad</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3) If more information is provided, will the scorecard measure improve?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. The scorecards are automatically recalculated every night. If an MP, member of their staff or indeed member of the public has contact information not currently included on KuvakaZim, please submit it to us using the ‘Correct This Information’ button on the appropriate MP page and we will add it to the site.</p>

<p><strong>4) I have tried using the phone number/email address listed on the site and it is not working - what should I do?</strong></p>

<p>Please let us know using the ‘Correct This Information’ button on the appropriate MP page and we will check then delete the information from the site.</p>

<p><strong>Hansard Appearances</strong></p>

<p><strong>1)What is Hansard, what are appearances, why are they important?</strong></p>

<p>The official record of the Zimbabwe National Assembly is called the Hansard – it is named after the British publication of parliamentary proceedings. We will take all of the Hansard records from start of Parliament and onwards and put them onto KuvakaZim in an easy to use, searchable form. From the Hansard records we track every time an MP speaks in Parliament - denoting each instance of them speaking as an ‘appearance’. We believe that appearances are important for a number of reasons. Firstly they show that the MP was actually in Parliament that day. Secondly, the role of an MP is to represent the interests and concerns of the citizens who elected them. One of the means of achieving this is through speaking in Parliament on their behalf.</p>

<p><strong>2) How is the Appearance Scorecard Measure Calculated?</strong></p>

<p>The number of appearances for each MP will be counted per six months period. Ratings were then applied as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>60+ appearances - Good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6 - 59 appearances - Neutral</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>&lt;6 appearances - Bad</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3) Will you update the scores when parliament returns to session?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, we will update the scores once parliament returns, maintaining a rolling 6-month basis for calculating the scores.</p>

<p><strong>4) Will you take into account the fact that an MP might only have recently been elected in a by-election and have not had the opportunity to speak in all of the last six months?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, we believe that we have accounted for all of these instances, but if you come across an instance where you think we might have made an error, please let us know using the ‘Correct This Information’ button on the appropriate page.</p>

<p><strong>5) When I look at the Hansard records on the site I notice that in a few cases the name of the speaker is not a link. What has happened there and will that affect the score of an MP?</strong></p>

<p>In determining who has spoken in parliament we have to rely upon the accuracy of the official record itself. There are some instances where insufficient information has been entered into Hansard to identify a specific speaker.</p>

<p><strong>6) If someone speaks three times in the same debate, does that count as three appearances, or one?</strong></p>

<p>It counts as three appearances.</p>

<p><strong>CDF Performance</strong></p>

<p><strong>1) What is CDF?</strong></p>

<p>The Constituency Development Fund (CDF) is one of the initiatives that were launched after the formation of the Inclusive Government in the fiscal budget of 2009/ 2010. The CDF is meant to support developmental efforts at constituency levels while at the same time complementing other programs and projects launched at national level. A total allocation of US$ 8 million was set aside for 210 constituencies in the initial fund. From this amount, each Member of Parliament (MP) was given US$50 000 upon applying for these funds. Essentially, the fund provides additional resources for constituency development by channeling money to constituencies under the management of the MPs. It aims at ensuring a portion of the Government Annual Revenue is earmarked for constituencies to finance development projects qualified on a priority basis arrived at by members of a constituency.An MP has a significant role to play in ensuring that CDF funds are used effectively to ensure that poverty is reduced in their constituency.</p>

<p><strong>8) I think you have made a mistake with your numbers - what should I do?</strong></p>

<p>If you think you have found an error, please let us know using the ‘Correct This Information’ button on the appropriate page.</p>
